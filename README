Another change to first line for another pop at auto-merging this file with the one in the foo_feature branch and then using the vi editor to change from default merge message. ANOTHER CHANGE TO FIRST LINE. This project is totally awesome, you guys.

Back in because of my mistaken commit message a second ago. Making another change so I can create a new commit message - one that is correct. :-) A third CHANGE TO SECOND LINE HERE. This project will help the totally awesome Treehouse students learn to work with Git repositories.
